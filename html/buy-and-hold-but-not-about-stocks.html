This is an investment strategy I was thinking could be applied to other areas of my life. A better name might be "Choose and Hold".

Let's be more practical. One of my goals for this year is to focus on a few things in each area and stick with them. Some examples:

- Subscribe to ~3 channels in each area (investments, religion, technology, and entertainment) and watch only those.
- Follow a few people on X (20 currently)
- Have at most 5 personal projects (3 currently)

Why I'm doing this? There are some reasons:
- Avoid getting trapped by the algorithm and distractions.
- Be an active consumer: I choose what I consume.
- Be selective: consume the best content.
- Use time wisely: consuming less gives me more time to enjoy my choices.</div>
