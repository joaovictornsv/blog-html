I think everyone should have at least one.

Small goals keep you in an evolving spiral. They serve as checkpoints of progress that give you direction and focus.

Let me share my example: I want to become strong enough to perform calisthenics movements and positions.

This week I achieved my current small goal: doing a muscle up. For me, it was a victory, a small one, but still a victory. It keeps me motivated to reach the next checkpoint.

And you? What's your current small goal? Baking a cake? Running a kilometer? Choose yours and start the game!</div>
