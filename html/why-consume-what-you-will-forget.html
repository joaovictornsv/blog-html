      <div id="post-body">February 2026

What was the last short video you watched? Probably you don't remember. Let me make it easier: mention one post you liked today. Easier, but still hard.

Last question: what was the last book you read? I think this one was the easiest to remember, right?

We don't remember almost everything we consume. It's dangerous because we're teaching our mind not to retain anything. Just consume, then throw away. Our minds are becoming like the passengers from the Wall-E movie.

I'm not saying you need to remember everything. The idea is to reflect on how we spend our time and energy. Are we only consuming what will be forgotten?

How many times do we actually think about and process what we've read, listened to, or watched?

Again, I'm not trying to be the super-productive guy. It's just a reminder: to keep your mind healthy, you need to use it.
