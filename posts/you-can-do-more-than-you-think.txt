You can do more than you think

#### "I don't have time"

You don't need more time, you need more focus. Track your day to see how you're using your hours. Then, find and eliminate distractions.

#### "I have much to do"

If you only have two hours to work on tasks, which one will you prioritize? Start prioritizing. Just:
1. Take a task
2. Complete it
3. Repeat.

#### "It's hard"

Use AI for as much as possible.
