You don't need more time, you need more focus
February 2025

I try to apply this rule to all areas of my life. Today I'll show this process in one area: watching YouTube videos.

I use a Chrome extension called Unhook. It hides all unnecessary information from my screen.

With this, I choose what I want to consume and stay focused on one video at a time, without comment or recommendation distractions.
