This DNS can save you.

It's the DNS for OpenDNS Family Shield, a free service by [OpenDNS](https://www.opendns.com/).

Once configured on your laptop, smartphone or router, this DNS protects your network from phishing sites, malwares distributors, and **adult content**. Any attempts to access these types of sites will be automatically blocked.

For setup instructions, check out OpenDNS's guide: [Setup guide OpenDNS FamilyShield](https://www.opendns.com/setupguide/#familyshield)

With this configuration, it's easier to keep your home and corporate network safe. Plus, it can also help against certain "bad habits", if you know what I mean.

Hope this is useful to you!
