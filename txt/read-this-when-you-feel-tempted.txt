Read this when you feel tempted
February 2026

You're not fighting with yourself, you're fighting with a demon.

It's not a struggle of the mind, it's a battle with a demon.

It's not a voice in your head, it's a demon whispering in your ear.

When you feel tempted, imagine a demon beside you, waiting for your fall so it can laugh in your face.

"For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."
- Ephesians 6:12
