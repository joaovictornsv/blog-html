You don't need to have a SaaS
February 2026

Sometime ago, I was talking with a friend about how hard it is to join the market. He told me: "I don't want to become an influencer, to have a job". What he means is he doesn't want to post on LinkedIn every day, or be an active user in a community to have a job. On that day, I thought: "Bro, you're living in social media days, adapt to it". But I was wrong, and now I think differently.

You should be visible, it's true. But it doesn't mean you need to launch a SaaS, have X followers, or have a digital product to be successful. Now, for me, to be successful, you need to be good (very good) and easy to find. Followers and digital products can come later, or never, and it's okay.

If you want to read more about it, I posted a text called "My Illusion of Making Money on the Internet".

See you next time.
